Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.7

**Defect
    * [KDT-5] - k-nearest neighbors search works for k > 1 but
                sometimes produces incorrect result for k = 1

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.6

**Defect
    * [KDT-3] - Test code coverage includes only kd_tree_test

** New Feature
    * [KDT-1] - Add nearest (single) neighbor search
    * [KDT-2] - Add k-nearest neighbors search

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.5

** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Add kd_tree assignment and equality operators.

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.4

** Bug
    * [No Issue] - Fix bug where floating point type coordinates (integral
                   types are unaffected) can produce incomplete range
                   searches for values <= 0.
** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Make upper/lower bounds and dimensions public traits.

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.3

** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Migrate unit tests from cppunit to boost test.
    * [No Issue] - Detect whether std::tr1 or std namespace is used
                   by compiler for TR1 extensions and use appropriate one.

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.2

** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Add const qualifiers to immutable local variables
                   and pointer arguments to potentially assist compiler
                   optimization.
    * [No Issue] - Refine and simplify erase(iterator).

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.1

** Bug
    * [No Issue] - Fix initialization list bug in unit test that produced
                   non-uniformly distributed test data.
** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Update kd_tree::erase(kd_tree::iterator) to return an
                   iterator pointing to the next element, per C++0x associative
                   container requirements.

Release Notes - libssrckdtree - Version 1.0.0

** Improvement
    * [No Issue] - Remove Point class and make kd_tree work with any class
                   conforming to the TR1 fixed size array interface
**Task
    * [No Issue] - Remove camel case class and function names, making
                   style more consistent with STL
